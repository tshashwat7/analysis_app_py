my requirement was to load stocks based on index and run quick scores to get overall recommendation(composite scoring 40 tech 40 fundamental and 20 bull) , and bull signal , after then when you click on any stock it would show the detail analysis on that stock where trade recommendation , stop loss, entry point sl , metrics are shown from there you can go further deep by clicking view flowchart there again multiple metrics are mapped to show predefined conditions based on metrics values. this app was designed to make decision entry to trade for short long and multibagger returns



this is my python app on stock analysis, could you check it out i have some questions regarding this - how reliable you think outcome of this app would be , are there any incorrect lgic used in calculation of metrics or signal how would you rate this app? if you have any questions please ask

it applies composite scoring while score received in score_indicators and compute_fundamental_score are already normalized not exceeding 100
